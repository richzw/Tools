// Subscribe to events emitted by the producer with some buffer size.
// If the subscriber consumes and processes events slower than what the producer emits,
// there is a chance the producer can drop the event if the subscriber takes longer than the DEFAULT_BROADCAST_TIMEOUT
// duration. It is recommended to specify a buffer size to ensure event emission does not get blocked and that subscribers
// always receive their required events.
//
// To compute an optimal buffer size for a channel given the event production rate 𝑃 and
// consumption rate 𝑄, consider the following:
// If production is faster than consumption, buffer size needs to be large enough to accommodate excess events.
// A basic way to determine a recommended buffer size is (P−Q)×T, where T is a time period over which
// the subscriber needs to handle basic events. If there are 100 events per second, and the processing routine
// can only handle 90, being able to handle excess events over a 10 second period gives us a minimum buffer size of 100.
